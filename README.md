# DareDevil
 A tool used to try and figure out where the star is for my friends game  
[Mercerenies' Blind Man's Rampage](https://github.com/Mercerenies/blind-mans-rampage-board)  

Basically the goal is to find the star, however no one knows that the board is  
DareDevil takes information of spaces already discovered and their possible branches to guess the probability of what those unknown spaces are
